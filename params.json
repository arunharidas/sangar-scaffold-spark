{"body":"#sangar-scaffold-spark\r\n\r\n###A new way to do scaffolding (works with php-activerecord and MySql).\r\n\r\nSangar Scaffolds creates the files for CRUD operations for you!\r\n\r\nIt creates the tables on the database, the controllers, the models and the views.\r\n\r\nIt also modifies the routes.php file.\r\n\r\nYou can create forms with the followings elements:\r\n\r\n- name\r\n- textarea\r\n- radiobuttons\r\n- checkboxes\r\n- select\r\n- select 1:N (populate the form select with a existent Model)\r\n- upload images (with thumbnail creation and uploads rules)\r\n- upload files (with uploads rules)\r\n- hidden relational (It's a special element. Only one hidden relational by scaffolding is allowed. It will produce a form with relation 1:N linked with his parent form automatically)\r\n\r\nEach element has validation rules and the possibility to do it multilanguage.\r\n\r\nCreate also a paginated list view.\r\n\r\n##New Version 0.0.2\r\n- You can now select if you want models with Codeigniter ActiveRecord or php-activerecord (you need to install via sparks).\r\n- Delete php-activerecord dependencies\r\n- Fixed bugs\r\n\r\n##Server Requirements\r\n\r\nPHP version 5.3.5 or newer.\r\nThis version only works with MySql (postgres in progress..)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you want to use php-activerecord as ORM instead of Codeigniter ActiveRecord, you need to install the php-activerecord sparks\r\n\r\n\tphp tools/spark install -v0.0.2 php-activerecord\r\n\r\n\r\n##Sangar-scaffold-spark requirements\r\n\r\n###URL Structure\r\n\r\nThe only allowed URL structure is the following:\r\n\r\n    http://www.yourdomain.com/controller/action/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Disable index_page\r\n\r\nSangar-scaffold-spark needs that you don't use 'index.php' in your base_url.\r\n\r\nTo disable this function, go to the config folder and edit the config.php\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange\r\n\r\n    $config['index_page'] = 'index.php';\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n    $config['index_page'] = '';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate and .htaccess file in your root folder with the following code:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAddDefaultCharset UTF-8\r\n\r\n\tRewriteEngine on\r\n\r\n\tRewriteCond $1 !^(index\\.php|public|robots\\.txt)\r\n\r\n\tRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemove the index.php file on Codeigniter User Guide: http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/urls.html\r\n\r\n\r\n###Access via domain, not via localhost\r\n\r\nYou must create a virtualhost (and modify your host file) and access your Codeigniter project via domain, don't use localhost. \r\nFor example, you must use www.yourdomain.com instead of http://localhost/yourdomain\r\n\r\n\r\n##How to use it?\r\n\r\nYou can install via sparks manager:\r\n\r\n\tphp tools/spark install -v0.0.1 sangar-scaffold \r\n\r\n\r\nOr install manually, copy the spark files in your application folder. Each one in its respective folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopy the file controllers/scaffolds.php and views/scaffolds_create.php of this spark in your application directory. Each one in its respective folders.\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your autoload file (/config/autoload.php)\r\n\r\n\t$autoload['sparks'] = array('sangar-scaffold/0.0.1', 'php-activerecord/0.0.2');\r\n\r\n\r\nGo to the scaffold page\r\n\r\n\twww.yourdomain.com/scaffolds\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions and create a new scaffold\r\n\r\nThis will create the files which you need to do CRUD operations (controller, model, and two views: create and list).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##How create a new scaffold\r\n\r\n- Write the Controller name you want produce.\r\n- Write the Model name you want produce.\r\n- Copy the code blocks of elements you need and paste to scaffold code textarea. Each code block must be separated by commas. The scaffold code is a JSON without the first '{' and the last '}'\r\n- Choose the options you want\r\n- Scaffold!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Multilanguage form inputs\r\n\r\nIf you need that your inputs could be multilingual, you must create an array of languages at your config.php\r\n    \r\n    $config['languages'] = array(\"en\" => \"english\",\"es\" => \"spanish\");\r\n\r\nAnd you must to add a new config parameter to say which is the actual language\r\n\r\n\t$config['prefix_language']\t= 'en';\r\n\r\n\r\n##Folder for uploads\r\n\r\nIf you want to upload files, you must create a folder in your root folder named public, and inside this, another folder called uploads. Your uploads will go there. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n##CSS for scaffolds\r\n\r\nIf you want, you will find a css to link with your scaffold code inside the resources directory. It will look much better. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
