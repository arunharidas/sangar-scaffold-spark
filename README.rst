Installation
************

Disable index_page
=====================

Sangar-scaffold-spark needs that you don't uses 'index.php' in your base_url.

To disable this function, go to the config folder and edit the config.php



Change

    $config['index_page'] = 'index.php';

for

    $config['index_page'] = '';




Create and .htaccess file in your root folder with the following code:


	AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

	RewriteEngine on

	RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|public|robots\.txt)

	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L]



Removing the index.php file on Codeigniter User Guide:

************
How to use it?
************

Copy the file controllers/scaffolds.php and views/scaffolds_create.php of this spark in your application directory. Each one in their respective folders.

Go to the scaffold page

	www.yourdomain.com/scaffolds

Follow the instructions and create a new scaffold

This will create the files that you need to do a CRUD operations (controller, model, and two views: create and list).

It Includes pagination and file upload.

How create a new scaffold

************
Folder for uploads
************

If you want to uploads files, you must create a folder in your root folder named public, and inside this, another folder called uploads. It will be here where your files will be uploaded. :)




************
CSS for scaffolds
************

If you want, you will find into the resources directory a css to link with your scaffold code. It will look much better. :)
